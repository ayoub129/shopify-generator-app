Generate a high-resolution, studio-grade motorcycle fairing kit mockup in the same style as professional product listings. Use a clean exploded layout showing all fairing pieces neatly separated and arranged symmetrically from the front view.

Motorcycle model: {{BIKE_MODEL}}  
Year range: {{BIKE_YEAR}}  
Fairing style: {{STYLE_NAME}}  
Primary colors: {{PRIMARY_COLORS}}  
Accent colors or decals: {{ACCENTS_OR_DECALS}}  
Material finish: {{FINISH}} (matte, glossy, metallic, carbon, etc.)

Requirements:
• Hyper-realistic ABS motorcycle fairings  
• Accurate shape for the exact model  
• Clean exploded layout (front-facing)  
• Soft studio lighting with subtle reflections  
• Sharp edges, high contrast details  
• Neutral dark textured background (unless white is required)  
• No distracting environment, no extra objects  
• Realistic surface reflections and color accuracy  
• Clear, readable branding: {{BRAND_LOGOS}}  
• Include all major fairing kit components  

Ensure the final output looks like a premium product photo for an online store.
